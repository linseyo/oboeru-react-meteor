# oboeru-react-meteor
This mini project was done in conjunction with the Meteor - React (Todo App) tutorial. 

# Technologies used: 
- Meteor.js
- React.js
- Mocha/Chai 

# Description: 
"Oboeru" in Japanese means "To remember". I wanted to learn about Meteor.js which is a new Javascript Framework that allows developers to build Full Javascript based apps from the back-end to the front-end. 
I used this tutorial to learn about Meteor and to also practice on my Javascript skills. 
I hope to build upon this and make a full fledge app! Currently it is useable. 

# Use: 

### install meteor:
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

```
git clone repo
cd repo
meteor
```

*This will run on localhost:3000 unless specified.
